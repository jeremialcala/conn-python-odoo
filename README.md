# Odoo connector module (conn-python-odoo)

### This is a simple connector for Odoo using odoorpc.

Our objective is to develop a basic module that connects to ODOO using odoorpc. This module will act as a microservice connector that receives requests for data and connects to the Odoo instance to execute the request. At the moment, the focus will be on Sales and Product Inventory.
